"Mobius is the fastest mule in Italy.  She can run at a top speed of 13 miles per hour when she is without any load to carry, and she can travel at 11 miles per hour as her top speed when she carries a typical load.  If she travels the 143 miles from Florence, Italy to Rome, Italy at top speed while carrying a typical load, then returns to Florence at her usual top speed without carrying a load, how long, in hours, will the trip take if she takes two 30-minute rest stops during each half of the trip?","30 minutes is 30/60=<<30/60=0.5>>0.5 hours.
Two 30-minute rest stops take 0.5*2-1 hour.
If she takes two rest stops per each half of the journey, then she takes 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours in rest time.
With a load, at her top speed, she can travel 143 miles in 143/11=<<143/11=13>>13 hours.
Without a load, at her top speed, she can travel 143 miles in 143/13=<<143/13=11>>11 hours.
Thus, the round trip will take 13+11+2=<<13+11+2=26>>26 hours.
#### 26","**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**
The problem asks for the total time taken for a round trip from Florence to Rome and back. The trip has two legs: one with a load and one without. Each leg has two halves, and each half includes two 30-minute rest stops. We need to calculate the travel time for each leg and add the rest stop times.

**2. Identify Key Information:**
*   Distance from Florence to Rome: 143 miles
*   Top speed with load: 11 miles per hour
*   Top speed without load: 13 miles per hour
*   Number of rest stops per half of the trip: 2
*   Duration of each rest stop: 30 minutes

**3. Interpret Phrases Precisely:**
*   ""top speed while carrying a typical load"": This means we use 11 mph for the trip to Rome.
*   ""returns to Florence at her usual top speed without carrying a load"": This means we use 13 mph for the trip back to Florence.
*   ""two 30-minute rest stops during each half of the trip"": This means for each leg of the journey (Florence to Rome, and Rome to Florence), there are two halves, and each half has two rest stops. This implies a total of 4 rest stops per leg, or 8 rest stops in total for the round trip.

**4. Formulate and Execute Calculations:**

*   **Calculate travel time from Florence to Rome (with load):**
    *   Distance = 143 miles
    *   Speed = 11 mph
    *   Time = Distance / Speed
    *   Time (Florence to Rome) = 143 miles / 11 mph = 13 hours

*   **Calculate travel time from Rome to Florence (without load):**
    *   Distance = 143 miles
    *   Speed = 13 mph
    *   Time = Distance / Speed
    *   Time (Rome to Florence) = 143 miles / 13 mph = 11 hours

*   **Calculate total travel time:**
    *   Total Travel Time = Time (Florence to Rome) + Time (Rome to Florence)
    *   Total Travel Time = 13 hours + 11 hours = 24 hours

*   **Calculate total rest stop time:**
    *   Each leg of the trip is divided into two halves.
    *   Each half has two 30-minute rest stops.
    *   So, for one leg, there are 2 halves * 2 stops/half = 4 rest stops.
    *   The duration of rest stops per leg = 4 stops * 30 minutes/stop = 120 minutes.
    *   Convert minutes to hours: 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours of rest per leg.
    *   Since there are two legs (Florence to Rome, and Rome to Florence), the total rest stop time is 2 hours/leg * 2 legs = 4 hours.

*   **Calculate the total trip time:**
    *   Total Trip Time = Total Travel Time + Total Rest Stop Time
    *   Total Trip Time = 24 hours + 4 hours = 28 hours

**5. Explain Each Step:**
*   We first calculated the time taken for the journey from Florence to Rome by dividing the distance by the speed Mobius travels with a load.
*   Next, we calculated the time taken for the return journey from Rome to Florence by dividing the distance by the speed Mobius travels without a load.
*   We then summed these two travel times to get the total time spent moving.
*   We determined the total number of rest stops. The problem states ""two 30-minute rest stops during each half of the trip."" This means for the trip to Rome, there are two halves, and each half has two stops, totaling 4 stops. Similarly, for the return trip, there are another 4 stops. In total, there are 8 rest stops.
*   We calculated the total duration of these rest stops by multiplying the number of stops by the duration of each stop and converting it to hours.
*   Finally, we added the total travel time and the total rest stop time to find the overall duration of the trip.

**6. Aggregate Results:**
The travel time for the outbound journey is 13 hours. The travel time for the return journey is 11 hours. The total travel time is 24 hours. The total rest stop time is 4 hours. The total trip time is 28 hours.

"Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?","Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15 unused crayons from each box.
So, a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 unused crayons are in the two boxes.
For the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box.
Hence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 unused crayons.
So, a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes.
Therefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 16 + 24 = <<30+16+24=70>>70 unused crayons.
#### 70","**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**
The problem asks us to find the total number of unused crayons Madeline has across 5 boxes. We are given information about the number of crayons per box and the proportion of used/unused crayons in different sets of boxes.

**2. Identify Key Information:**
*   Total number of boxes: 5
*   Crayons per box: 24
*   Box group 1 (2 boxes): 5/8 of crayons were not yet used.
*   Box group 2 (2 boxes): 2/3 of crayons were used.
*   Box group 3 (1 box): Information about usage is incomplete, but it implies some crayons are unused. The phrasing ""the last box was not entirely used"" suggests that some crayons in this box are unused. However, without a specific fraction or number for this box, we must assume that the problem intends for us to calculate the unused crayons from the first two groups of boxes only, as the information for the last box is insufficient to contribute to a numerical answer. If the problem intended to include the last box, it would need to specify the proportion of unused crayons in it. Given the structure, it's most likely that the question is implicitly asking for the unused crayons from the boxes where usage is specified.

**3. Interpret Phrases Precisely:**
*   ""5/8 of the crayons... were not yet used"": This directly tells us the fraction of unused crayons.
*   ""2/3 of the crayons were used"": This means the fraction of unused crayons is 1 - 2/3.

**4. Formulate and Execute Calculations:**

*   **Total crayons per box:** 24 crayons/box

*   **Box group 1 (2 boxes):**
    *   Number of crayons in these 2 boxes: 2 boxes * 24 crayons/box = 48 crayons
    *   Fraction of unused crayons in these 2 boxes: 5/8
    *   Number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes: (5/8) * 48 crayons = 5 * (48 / 8) crayons = 5 * 6 crayons = 30 unused crayons

*   **Box group 2 (2 boxes):**
    *   Number of crayons in these 2 boxes: 2 boxes * 24 crayons/box = 48 crayons
    *   Fraction of used crayons in these 2 boxes: 2/3
    *   Fraction of unused crayons in these 2 boxes: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3
    *   Number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes: (1/3) * 48 crayons = 48 / 3 crayons = 16 unused crayons

*   **Box group 3 (1 box):**
    *   As noted in step 2, the information for this box is insufficient to calculate a specific number of unused crayons. We will proceed with the assumption that the question is asking for the total unused crayons from the boxes where usage is specified.

*   **Total unused crayons:**
    *   Sum of unused crayons from box group 1 and box group 2: 30 unused crayons + 16 unused crayons = 46 unused crayons

**5. Explain Each Step:**
*   We first calculated the total number of crayons in each group of boxes to ensure we were working with the correct quantities.
*   For the first group of 2 boxes, we directly applied the given fraction of unused crayons (5/8) to the total number of crayons in those boxes.
*   For the second group of 2 boxes, we first determined the fraction of unused crayons by subtracting the fraction of used crayons (2/3) from 1. Then, we applied this fraction of unused crayons to the total number of crayons in those boxes.
*   We acknowledged that the information for the last box was insufficient to calculate a numerical value for unused crayons.
*   Finally, we added the number of unused crayons from the first two groups to get the total number of unused crayons.

**6. Aggregate Results:**
The unused crayons from the first 2 boxes are 30.
The unused crayons from the next 2 boxes are 16.
The total unused crayons from these specified boxes is 30 + 16 = 46.

She has gotten 9 haircuts towards her 6th free one because 14 - 5 = <<14-5=9>>9
She has gotten 79 haircuts because 70 + 9 = <<70+9=79>>79
#### 79","**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**
The problem asks for the total number of haircuts Tammy has received. We are given information about a loyalty program where she gets a free haircut for every 14 paid haircuts. We know how many free haircuts she has received and how close she is to getting another one.

**2. Identify Key Information:**
*   Free haircut condition: 1 free haircut for every 14 paid haircuts.
*   Free haircuts already received: 5.
*   Haircuts away from the next free one: 5.

**3. Interpret Phrases Precisely:**
*   ""For every 14 haircuts, she gets a free additional haircut"": This means that after accumulating 14 paid haircuts, she earns one free haircut. The free haircuts themselves do not count towards earning more free haircuts.

**4. Formulate and Execute Calculations:**

*   **Calculate the number of paid haircuts needed for the free ones she has received:**
    Since she gets 1 free haircut for every 14 paid haircuts, and she has received 5 free haircuts, she must have completed 5 sets of 14 paid haircuts.
    Paid haircuts for free ones = 5 free haircuts * 14 paid haircuts/free haircut = 70 paid haircuts.

*   **Calculate the number of paid haircuts she has received towards her *next* free haircut:**
    She is 5 haircuts away from another free one. This means she has completed 14 - 5 = 9 paid haircuts towards her next free one.

*   **Calculate the total number of paid haircuts:**
    Total paid haircuts = Paid haircuts for free ones + Paid haircuts towards the next free one
    Total paid haircuts = 70 + 9 = 79 paid haircuts.

*   **Determine the total number of haircuts she has gotten:**
    The question asks for ""how many haircuts has she gotten there?"". This implies the total number of haircuts she has *received*, which includes both paid and free haircuts.
    Total haircuts received = Total paid haircuts + Free haircuts already received
    Total haircuts received = 79 + 5 = 84 haircuts.

**5. Explain Each Step:**
*   We first determined the number of paid haircuts that led to the 5 free haircuts she has already earned. This is done by multiplying the number of free haircuts by the number of paid haircuts required for each free one.
*   Next, we figured out how many paid haircuts she has accumulated since her last free haircut. If she is 5 away from the next free one, she has completed 14 - 5 = 9 paid haircuts towards it.
*   We then summed the paid haircuts that earned her previous free haircuts and the paid haircuts she has earned towards her next free one to get the total number of paid haircuts.
*   Finally, to find the total number of haircuts she has *gotten*, we added the total paid haircuts to the free haircuts she has already received.

**6. Aggregate Results:**
The calculations have been aggregated to arrive at the total number of haircuts.

She also walked for 5*24 = <<5*24=120>>120 miles for her exercise.
She covered 120+64 = <<120+64=184>>184 miles while doing her exercise.
#### 184","**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**
The problem asks for the total distance Mairead covered during her exercises. This total distance is composed of three activities: running, walking, and jogging. We are given the distance for running and relationships to calculate the distances for walking and jogging.

**2. Identify Key Information:**
*   Running distance = 40 miles
*   Walking distance = 3/5 times as many miles as she ran.
*   Walking distance = five times the number of miles she jogged.

**3. Interpret Phrases Precisely:**
*   ""3/5 times as many miles as she ran"": This means we multiply the running distance by 3/5.
*   ""five times the number of miles she jogged"": This means the walking distance is 5 times the jogging distance. We can use this to find the jogging distance.

**4. Formulate and Execute Calculations:**

*   **Calculate the walking distance:**
    The problem states Mairead walks for 3/5 times as many miles as she ran.
    Walking distance = (3/5) * Running distance
    Walking distance = (3/5) * 40 miles
    Walking distance = (3 * 40) / 5 miles
    Walking distance = 120 / 5 miles
    Walking distance = 24 miles

*   **Calculate the jogging distance:**
    The problem states Mairead walks for five times the number of miles she jogged. This means:
    Walking distance = 5 * Jogging distance
    We know the walking distance is 24 miles. So, we can rearrange the formula to find the jogging distance:
    Jogging distance = Walking distance / 5
    Jogging distance = 24 miles / 5
    Jogging distance = 4.8 miles

*   **Calculate the total distance:**
    The total distance is the sum of the running, walking, and jogging distances.
    Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance + Jogging distance
    Total distance = 40 miles + 24 miles + 4.8 miles
    Total distance = 64 miles + 4.8 miles
    Total distance = 68.8 miles

**5. Explain Each Step:**
*   We first calculated the walking distance by taking 3/5 of the running distance, as specified in the problem.
*   Next, we used the relationship between walking and jogging distance to find the jogging distance. Since walking distance is five times the jogging distance, we divided the walking distance by 5.
*   Finally, we added up the distances for running, walking, and jogging to find the total distance covered.

**6. Aggregate Results:**
All individual distances have been calculated and summed to provide the total distance.

The problem asks us to find the number of students in a class. We are given information about the number of pizza slices ordered per student, the total number of pizzas ordered, the number of slices per large pizza, and the number of leftover slices of each type.

**2. Identify Key Information:**
*   Slices per student: 2 cheese, 1 onion.
*   Slices per large pizza: 18.
*   Total pizzas ordered: 6.
*   Leftover slices: 8 cheese, 4 onion.

**3. Interpret Phrases Precisely:**
The phrases ""2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion for every student"" and ""eat exactly that amount"" are straightforward.

**4. Formulate and Execute Calculations:**

*   **Calculate the total number of cheese slices ordered:**
    Each large pizza has 18 slices.
    Total pizzas ordered = 6.
    Total cheese slices ordered = Total pizzas * Slices per pizza
    Total cheese slices ordered = 6 * 18 = 108 slices.

*   **Calculate the total number of onion slices ordered:**
    Each large pizza has 18 slices.
    Total pizzas ordered = 6.
    Total onion slices ordered = Total pizzas * Slices per pizza
    Total onion slices ordered = 6 * 18 = 108 slices.

*   **Calculate the total number of cheese slices eaten by students:**
    Total cheese slices ordered = 108 slices.
    Leftover cheese slices = 8 slices.
    Total cheese slices eaten = Total cheese slices ordered - Leftover cheese slices
    Total cheese slices eaten = 108 - 8 = 100 slices.

*   **Calculate the total number of onion slices eaten by students:**
    Total onion slices ordered = 108 slices.
    Leftover onion slices = 4 slices.
    Total onion slices eaten = Total onion slices ordered - Leftover onion slices
    Total onion slices eaten = 108 - 4 = 104 slices.

*   **Determine the number of students based on cheese slices eaten:**
    Each student eats 2 pieces of cheese.
    Total cheese slices eaten = 100 slices.
    Number of students = Total cheese slices eaten / Slices of cheese per student
    Number of students = 100 / 2 = 50 students.

*   **Determine the number of students based on onion slices eaten:**
    Each student eats 1 piece of onion.
    Total onion slices eaten = 104 slices.
    Number of students = Total onion slices eaten / Slices of onion per student
    Number of students = 104 / 1 = 104 students.

**5. Explain Each Step:**
We first calculated the total number of cheese and onion slices available from the ordered pizzas. Then, we subtracted the leftover slices to find out how many slices of each type were actually consumed. Finally, we used the consumption rate per student for each type of pizza to determine the number of students.

**6. Aggregate Results:**
We have two different numbers of students based on the cheese and onion slices eaten (50 and 104). This indicates there might be an inconsistency in the problem statement as written, or a misunderstanding of how the pizza was distributed. However, the problem states ""For every student in the class, she will buy 2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion and they will eat exactly that amount."" This implies a fixed ratio of consumption per student. If the number of students is consistent, then the number of slices eaten must also be consistent with that number of students.

Let 'S' be the number of students.
Cheese eaten = 2 * S
Onion eaten = 1 * S

From the leftovers:
Cheese eaten = 108 - 8 = 100
Onion eaten = 108 - 4 = 104

So, we have:
2 * S = 100  => S = 50
1 * S = 104  => S = 104

Since the number of students must be a single value, there is an inconsistency in the provided numbers. However, if we assume the problem intends for us to find a consistent number of students, we must re-examine the premise. The most direct interpretation of ""For every student in the class, she will buy 2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion and they will eat exactly that amount"" is that the number of students is determined by the total consumption.

Let's assume the number of students is consistent. The problem states ""For every student in the class, she will buy 2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion"". This implies that the number of students is the limiting factor for the *intended* consumption.

If there are 'S' students, then 2S cheese slices and 1S onion slices were eaten.
We calculated that 100 cheese slices were eaten and 104 onion slices were eaten.

If 2S = 100, then S = 50.
If 1S = 104, then S = 104.

This discrepancy suggests an error in the problem statement's numbers. However, if we must provide an answer, we should consider which piece of information is more likely to be the intended determinant. The phrasing ""For every student... she will buy 2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion"" suggests that the number of students dictates the *intended* purchase and consumption.

Let's re-evaluate the total slices eaten.
Total cheese slices eaten = 100
Total onion slices eaten = 104

If the number of students is 'S', then:
Cheese eaten = 2S
Onion eaten = S

This means that the number of cheese slices eaten should be twice the number of onion slices eaten.
100 is not twice of 104.

Let's assume the number of students is consistent and the consumption per student is fixed.
If there are 'S' students, then 2S cheese slices and S onion slices were eaten.

The number of cheese slices eaten is 100. So, 2S = 100, which means S = 50.
If S = 50, then the number of onion slices eaten should be 1 * 50 = 50.
However, 104 onion slices were eaten.

The number of onion slices eaten is 104. So, S = 104.
If S = 104, then the number of cheese slices eaten should be 2 * 104 = 208.
However, only 100 cheese slices were eaten.

There is a clear inconsistency in the problem statement. However, if we are forced to choose, the number of students is usually determined by the number of people present. The consumption rates are given per student.

Let's assume the number of students is 'S'.
Total cheese slices eaten = 2S
Total onion slices eaten = S

We know that 100 cheese slices were eaten. So, 2S = 100, which implies S = 50.
If there are 50 students, then they would have eaten 50 onion slices.
The problem states 104 onion slices were eaten. This means there's an excess of 104 - 50 = 54 onion slices that were not accounted for by the stated consumption per student.

Let's assume the number of students is 'S'.
Total cheese slices eaten = 100
Total onion slices eaten = 104

If the number of students is 'S', and each student eats 2 cheese and 1 onion, then the number of cheese slices eaten must be twice the number of onion slices eaten.
100 (cheese eaten) is not equal to 2 * 104 (twice the onion eaten).

Let's consider the possibility that the number of students is determined by the *minimum* of the two calculations, assuming one of the leftover numbers is incorrect.

If we use the cheese slices:
Number of students = 100 cheese slices / 2 cheese slices per student = 50 students.
If there are 50 students, they would eat 50 onion slices.
This would leave 108 - 50 = 58 onion slices, not 4.

If we use the onion slices:
Number of students = 104 onion slices / 1 onion slice per student = 104 students.
If there are 104 students, they would eat 104 * 2 = 208 cheese slices.
This is more than the total cheese slices ordered (108), which is impossible.

Given the impossibility of reconciling the numbers, there is likely an error in the problem statement. However, if we must proceed with the given numbers and assume a single number of students, we need to identify which calculation is more plausible or if there's a way to interpret the leftovers differently.

The most direct interpretation of ""For every student in the class, she will buy 2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion and they will eat exactly that amount"" is that the number of students is the primary driver.

Let's assume the number of students is 'S'.
Cheese eaten = 2S
Onion eaten = S

We have 100 cheese slices eaten and 104 onion slices eaten.
If 2S = 100, then S = 50.
If S = 50, then onion eaten should be 50. But 104 were eaten.

If S = 104, then cheese eaten should be 208. But only 100 were eaten.

The problem is mathematically inconsistent. However, if we assume that the number of students is determined by the cheese slices, as it's the first condition mentioned and leads to a plausible number of students without exceeding the total ordered, we can proceed with that.

Let's assume the number of students is determined by the cheese slices eaten.
Total cheese slices eaten = 100
Cheese slices per student = 2
Number of students = 100 / 2 = 50.

If there are 50 students, they would eat 50 onion slices.
The problem states 4 onion slices were leftover, meaning 108 - 4 = 104 onion slices were eaten.
This contradicts the assumption of 50 students.

Let's assume the number of students is determined by the onion slices eaten.
Total onion slices eaten = 104
Onion slices per student = 1
Number of students = 104 / 1 = 104.

If there are 104 students, they would eat 104 * 2 = 208 cheese slices.
The problem states 8 cheese slices were leftover, meaning 108 - 8 = 100 cheese slices were eaten.
This contradicts the assumption of 104 students.

The problem as stated is impossible to solve with a single, consistent number of students. However, if we are forced to provide an answer, we must assume one of the pieces of information is the intended determinant. The most common way such problems are structured is that the number of people dictates consumption.

Let's assume the number of students is 'S'.
Cheese eaten = 2S
Onion eaten = S

We have 100 cheese slices eaten and 104 onion slices eaten.
The ratio of cheese eaten to onion eaten should be 2:1.
The actual ratio is 100:104, which is approximately 1:1.

Given the inconsistency, let's re-read carefully. ""For every student in the class, she will buy 2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion and they will eat exactly that amount."" This implies a fixed ratio of consumption.

If we assume the number of students is 'S', then 2S cheese slices and S onion slices were eaten.
The number of cheese slices eaten is 100. So, 2S = 100, which means S = 50.
If S = 50, then the number of onion slices eaten should be 50.
However, 104 onion slices were eaten. This means there were 104 - 50 = 54 extra onion slices eaten that are not accounted for by the stated consumption per student.

If we assume the number of students is 'S', and the number of onion slices eaten is S.
The number of onion slices eaten is 104. So, S = 104.
If S = 104, then the number of cheese slices eaten should be 2 * 104 = 208.
However, only 100 cheese slices were eaten. This means there were 208 - 100 = 108 fewer cheese slices eaten than expected for 104 students.

The problem is fundamentally flawed. However, if we must select a number of students, and assuming the cheese consumption is the intended constraint that leads to the number of students:

Total cheese slices ordered = 6 pizzas * 18 slices/pizza = 108 slices.
Cheese slices eaten = 108 slices - 8 leftover slices = 100 slices.
Since each student eats 2 cheese slices, the number of students = 100 slices / 2 slices/student = 50 students.

Let's check if this is consistent with onion slices, acknowledging the inconsistency.
If there are 50 students, they would eat 50 * 1 = 50 onion slices.
Total onion slices ordered = 108 slices.
Leftover onion slices = 108 - 50 = 58 slices.
The problem states 4 onion slices were leftover. This is a significant discrepancy.

Given the impossibility of a consistent answer, and the instruction to provide a step-by-step reasoning, the most direct calculation for the number of students based on one of the pizza types is the best approach, while acknowledging the inconsistency. The cheese calculation yields a plausible number of students.

#### 146","**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**
The problem asks for the total number of fruits across four fruit baskets. We are given the quantities of apples, oranges, and bananas in the first three baskets and information about the quantities in the fourth basket.

**2. Identify Key Information:**
*   Number of fruit baskets: 4
*   Fruits in the first three baskets: 9 apples, 15 oranges, 14 bananas.
*   Fruits in the fourth basket: 2 less of each fruit compared to the first three baskets.

**3. Interpret Phrases Precisely:**
""2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket"" means we need to subtract 2 from the quantity of apples, oranges, and bananas individually to find the amounts in the fourth basket.

**4. Formulate and Execute Calculations:**

*   **Fruits in the first three baskets:**
    *   Total fruits in the first three baskets = (Number of apples) + (Number of oranges) + (Number of bananas)
    *   Total fruits in the first three baskets = 9 + 15 + 14 = 38 fruits.

*   **Fruits in the fourth basket:**
    *   Apples in the fourth basket = Apples in first three baskets - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 apples.
    *   Oranges in the fourth basket = Oranges in first three baskets - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 oranges.
    *   Bananas in the fourth basket = Bananas in first three baskets - 2 = 14 - 2 = 12 bananas.
    *   Total fruits in the fourth basket = 7 + 13 + 12 = 32 fruits.

*   **Total fruits in all four baskets:**
    *   Total fruits = (Total fruits in the first three baskets) + (Total fruits in the fourth basket)
    *   Total fruits = 38 + 32 = 70 fruits.

**5. Explain Each Step:**
*   We first calculated the total number of fruits in the first three baskets by summing the given quantities of apples, oranges, and bananas.
*   Next, we determined the number of each type of fruit in the fourth basket by subtracting 2 from the respective quantities in the first three baskets.
*   Then, we summed the fruits in the fourth basket to get its total.
*   Finally, we added the total fruits from the first three baskets and the fourth basket to arrive at the overall total.

"Students at Highridge High earn 2 points for each correct answer during a quiz bowl If a student correctly answers all the questions in a round, the student is awarded an additional 4 point bonus. They played a total of five rounds each consisting of five questions. If James only missed one question, how many points did he get?","If James only missed one question in all five rounds of five questions, he correctly answered 5 * 5 - 1 = <<5*5-1=24>>24 questions
Before the bonus, James earned 24 correct answers * 2 points/answer = <<24*2=48>>48 points.
Since missing one question would only disqualify him from receiving a bonus in one round, he would earn a bonus for 5-1=<<5-1=4>>4 rounds.
He should expect a bonus of 4 rounds* 4 points/round= <<4*4=16>>16 points.
Including his bonus, James scored a total of 48 + 16 = <<48+16=64>>64 points.
#### 66","**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**
The problem asks us to calculate the total points James earned in a quiz bowl. We are given information about the scoring system, the number of rounds, the number of questions per round, and the number of questions James missed.

**2. Identify Key Information:**
*   Points per correct answer: 2 points
*   Bonus for answering all questions in a round correctly: 4 points
*   Total number of rounds: 5 rounds
*   Number of questions per round: 5 questions
*   Number of questions James missed: 1 question

**3. Interpret Phrases Precisely:**
*   ""2 points for each correct answer"": This is a direct multiplier.
*   ""additional 4 point bonus"": This is a fixed bonus awarded under a specific condition.
*   ""only missed one question"": This implies he answered all other questions correctly.

**4. Formulate and Execute Calculations:**

*   **Total number of questions:**
    *   Each round has 5 questions, and there are 5 rounds.
    *   Total questions = Number of rounds * Questions per round
    *   Total questions = 5 * 5 = 25 questions

*   **Number of questions James answered correctly:**
    *   James missed 1 question out of the total 25 questions.
    *   Correct answers = Total questions - Missed questions
    *   Correct answers = 25 - 1 = 24 questions

*   **Points from correct answers:**
    *   James answered 24 questions correctly, and each correct answer is worth 2 points.
    *   Points from correct answers = Number of correct answers * Points per correct answer
    *   Points from correct answers = 24 * 2 = 48 points

*   **Determine which rounds received a bonus:**
    *   A bonus is awarded for answering *all* questions in a round correctly.
    *   James missed only one question in total across all five rounds. This means he did *not* answer all questions correctly in any single round.
    *   Therefore, James did not receive any bonus points.

*   **Total points:**
    *   Total points = Points from correct answers + Bonus points
    *   Total points = 48 + 0 = 48 points

**5. Explain Each Step:**
*   We first calculated the total number of questions in the quiz bowl by multiplying the number of rounds by the number of questions per round.
*   Next, we determined how many questions James answered correctly by subtracting the one missed question from the total number of questions.
*   We then calculated the points James earned from his correct answers by multiplying the number of correct answers by the points awarded for each correct answer.
*   We analyzed the condition for receiving a bonus (answering all questions in a round correctly) and concluded that since James missed one question overall, he did not achieve a perfect score in any single round, thus earning no bonus points.
*   Finally, we summed the points from correct answers and the bonus points to get James's total score.

**6. Aggregate Results:**
All calculations have been performed to arrive at the final score.
